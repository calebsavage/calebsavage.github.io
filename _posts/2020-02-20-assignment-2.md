title: Big LEDs - Assignment 2
---

* We had a great deal of trouble getting everything set up. We ran into a wall without having admin access to the production laptops to set up the network config and install DMXking.
* We got around it by setting things up on Zack’s windows laptop, which fortunately still has an ethernet port.
	* To set up a manual IP in Windows is a bit of a complex procedurehttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15089/windows-change-tcp-ip-settings


* We were able to install the free demo version of MadMapper, which has significant limitations but it was enough to get today’s assignment done. The main limitations are inability to save projects and the lights will go off for a few seconds each minute. We were able to get it set up with a predefined pattern as well as webcam images.

Thanks to Zack for creating these sweet gifs from Cy's photos!
