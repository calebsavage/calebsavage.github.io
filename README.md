#Missile Commander - Raindrop Style

##Click the raindrops to vaporize them before they hit the iPhone. 


##Known Shortcomings
+ Using window.alert and location.reload are not ideal ways to acomplish game over and restart
+ The cookie which saves the high score is not persistent, and sometimes  displays an = after the score (I noticed this when viewing on iPhone)
+ The amount of time a raindrop takes to fall from the top to the bottom of the screen is fixed, which means that the speed is variable depending on how steep the angle is. Some drops are harder to click than others.
